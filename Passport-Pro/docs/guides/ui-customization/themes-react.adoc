A final approach to customization is to just take pieces of the Admin Console or Account Console and use it in your own React application.

To fully customize these consoles, you can use the aformentioned React based npm packages.
Two packages exist:

* `@passport/passport-admin-ui`: This is the base theme for the Admin Console.
* `@passport/passport-account-ui`: This is the base theme for the Account Console.
Both packages are available in the public npm repository.

== Installing the packages

To install the packages, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm install @passport/passport-account-ui
----

== Using the packages

To use these pages, you add PassportProvider in your component hierarchy to choose the client, realm, and URL that you need.

[source,javascript]
----
import { PassportProvider } from "@passport/passport-ui-shared";

//...

<PassportProvider environment={{
      serverBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
      realm: "master",
      clientId: "security-admin-console"
  }}>
  {/* rest of you application */}
</PassportProvider>
----

== Translating the pages

The pages are translated using the `i18next` library.
You can set it up as described on the https://react.i18next.com/[react-i18next Website].
If you want to use the translations that are provided, add i18next-http-backend to your project and add the following:

[source,javascript]
----
backend: {
  loadPath: `http://localhost:8080/resources/master/account/{lng}}`,
  parse: (data: string) => {
    const messages = JSON.parse(data);

    const result: Record<string, string> = {};
    messages.forEach((v) => (result[v.key] = v.value)); //need to convert to record
    return result;
  },
},
----

== Using the pages

To see how to further integrate the pages, we recommend that you take a look at the output of the tool in the <<creating-your-own-console,Creating your own Console>> chapter.
