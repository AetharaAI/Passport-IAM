=== Packaging and deployment

In order for {project_name} to recognize the provider, you need to add a file to the JAR: `META-INF/services/org.passport.storage.UserStorageProviderFactory`. This file must contain a line-separated list of fully qualified classnames of the `UserStorageProviderFactory` implementations:

----
org.passport.examples.federation.properties.ClasspathPropertiesStorageFactory
org.passport.examples.federation.properties.FilePropertiesStorageFactory
----

To deploy this jar, copy it to the `providers/` directory, then run `bin/kc.[sh|bat] build`.
