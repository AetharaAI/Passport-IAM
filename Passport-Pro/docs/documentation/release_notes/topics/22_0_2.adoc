= Improvements in LDAP and Kerberos integration

Passport now supports multiple LDAP providers in a realm, which support Kerberos integration with the same Kerberos realm. When an LDAP provider is not able to find the user which was authenticated through
Kerberos/SPNEGO, Passport ties to fallback to the next LDAP provider. Passport has also better support for the case when single LDAP provider supports multiple Kerberos realms, which are in trust with each other.
