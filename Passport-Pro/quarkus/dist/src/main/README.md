Passport
========

To understand the contents of your Passport installation, see the [directory structure guide](https://www.passport-pro.ai/server/directory-structure).

To get help configuring Passport via the CLI, run:

on Linux/Unix:

    $ bin/kc.sh

on Windows:

    $ bin\kc.bat

To try Passport out in development mode, run: 

on Linux/Unix:

    $ bin/kc.sh start-dev

on Windows:

    $ bin\kc.bat start-dev

After the server boots, open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. The welcome page will indicate that the server is running.

To get started, check out the [configuration guides](https://www.passport-pro.ai/guides#server).
